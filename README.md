# Fake_News_Detection

The rapid spread of fake news has become a serious issue in todayâ€™s digital world. With thousands of news articles published every day, it is increasingly difficult to separate credible information from misleading content. To address this challenge, there is a need for systems that can automatically identify whether a news article is true or fake, thereby helping to reduce misinformation and maintain public trust.

In this project, we aim to build a Semantic Classification Model for fake news detection. By using Word2Vec to capture patterns and semantic relationships in the text, and applying supervised machine learning models, the system will learn to classify news articles as either True or Fake.
